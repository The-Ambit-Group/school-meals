            If your income is different this month than a normal month because of overtime, holiday pay, missing a couple of shifts at work, or some other unexpected reason, put down what you would have made if those things hadnâ€™t happened. For example, if you normally make $1000 each month, but you missed some work last month and only made $900, put down that you make $1000 per month. Similarly, if you normally make $500 per month, but you worked overtime and made $750, put down that you make $500 per month.
