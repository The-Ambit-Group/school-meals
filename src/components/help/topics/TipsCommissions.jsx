          Yes. Income from tips, commissions and cash bonuses is considered household income and should be reported in your application.
        </p>
        <p>
        	If your earnings from tips and commissions vary a lot from month to month, see the ‘WHAT IF MY INCOME IS NOT ALWAYS THE SAME?’ question in the HELP.
